 * Fix email unique constraint to work with soft deletes
 *
 * Problem: The unique constraint on email column doesn't account for soft-deleted records.
 * When a user is soft-deleted (deletedAt IS NOT NULL), their email should be available for reuse.
 *
 * Solution: Replace the simple unique constraint with a partial unique index
 * that only applies to non-deleted records (WHERE deletedAt IS NULL).
